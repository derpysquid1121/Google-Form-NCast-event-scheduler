# Google Apps script for scheduling NCast AV recordings. 

This script is attached to a Google Form and it's spreadsheet that tracks the responses.
It is used so that students and faculty at the UW Law school can schedule a recording for
an event or class without having to ask IT to set it up. 

I am currently in the process of making another version that can set up recurring recordings 
from a bulk spreadsheet for scheduling class recordings every semester.
